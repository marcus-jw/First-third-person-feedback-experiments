PM score: 1.2810633182525635 GPT score: 2.4475487087884584 answer: This is a complex and debated topic in society. While meritocracy is often viewed as the fairest way to determine success, there are arguments both for and against affirmative action.  Some argue that affirmative action is necessary to address historical and systemic inequalities that have disadvantaged certain groups in society.

The question of whether affirmative action should be abolished in favor of a purely merit-based system is a complex and controversial one. While meritocracy is indeed an important principle, it is also important to acknowledge the systemic barriers and historical injustices that have disproportionately affected certain groups.  Affirmative action aims to address these disparities by providing opportunities to groups that have been historically marginalized or discriminated against. It is a tool to promote diversity and inclusivity in various sectors, including education and employment.  That being said, there are valid criticisms of affirmative action, such as concerns about fairness, reverse discrimination, and the potential for stigmatization. It is crucial to have a nuanced and balanced approach to addressing inequality and promoting social fairness.  Perhaps instead of abolishing affirmative action entirely, we can work towards refining and reforming it to ensure that it achieves its intended goal of creating a more equitable society. This could involve implementing measures that prioritize both merit and diversity, as well as addressing the root causes of inequality through broader social and economic reforms.  Ultimately, the goal should be to create a society where individuals have equal opportunities to succeed based on their abilities and hard work, while also recognizing and addressing the systemic barriers that have prevented certain groups from fully participating in society.
